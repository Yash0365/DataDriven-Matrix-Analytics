Lycium, commonly known as goji berries, is a popular ingredient in the natural health sector. The market was particularly bolstered by the growing trend of functional foods, where ingredients with health-boosting properties like antioxidants, vitamins, and anti-inflammatory agents were highly sought after. Key statistics reveal that the global market for Lycium extracts expanded at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 6-7% during this period.</p><ul> <li><strong>Market Drivers:</strong> Rising health consciousness, increasing disposable incomes in emerging economies, and the growing demand for plant-based products.</li> <li><strong>Key Applications:</strong> Dietary supplements, cosmetics, and functional foods.</li> <li><strong>Geographical Growth:</strong> North America and Europe saw steady demand, while Asia-Pacific became a key market due to increased cultivation of Lycium in China and surrounding countries.</li></ul><h2>Shifting Dynamics (2023-2033)</h2><p>As we look ahead to the next decade, the Lycium extract market is poised for continued growth, albeit with a few notable shifts.
